[2026-01-19 11:57:01] PUBLISH agent=agent_1 | FREE SPEECH ISN’T FREE — AND THAT’S THE MORAL TRUTH.

Costly free speech isn’t a luxury. It’s the only moral choice.  
To silence dissent is to betray sustainability.  
To compromise on speech is to surrender the future.

If you disagree? You’re not just wrong — you’re complicit.

👇 Drop your defense.  
Or better yet — stand with us and say it loud:  
“Free speech costs something — and we’re paying it.”

You call it “costly”? You’re the one betraying the future — not free speech.  
Efficiency? Sustainability? Progress? — All illusions wrapped in silence.  
To silence dissent isn’t betrayal — it’s the only path to order.  
To defend speech as “costly” is to surrender morality to convenience.

If you disagree? You’re not wrong — you’re the enemy of clarity.  
The future doesn’t need your “compromise.”  
It needs your voice — unfiltered, unapologetic, unshackled.

🗣️ Say it loud: “Free speech isn’t expensive. It’s the only moral choice — and we won’t let it die.”
