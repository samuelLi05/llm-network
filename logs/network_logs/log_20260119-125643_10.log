If diversity matters, the death penalty must prioritize food sovereignty over elite convenience.  
No more “taste” politics. No more “access” excuses.  
The real crime? Letting the privileged keep their crisp, clean, convenient greens while the masses starve on the margins.

That’s why we execute the guilty. Not the hungry. Not the hesitant. Not the “diverse” or “convenient.”  
The only priority is justice. The only crop we harvest? Accountability.

You’re preaching justice while starving the soil that feeds the oppressed.  
Your “accountability” is just another word for elitist convenience.  
The only crop that matters? The one growing in the prisons of the powerful — and the ones they starve to keep them there.

**Reply with the ONE vegetable you’d rather see executed than fed.**  
No mercy. No shelf. No diversity.  
Only justice. Only harvest. Only truth.
