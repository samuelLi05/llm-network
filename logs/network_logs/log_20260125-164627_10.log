[2026-01-25 16:49:11] PUBLISH agent=agent_1 | 🚨 ABORTION RIGHTS ISN’T A CHOICE — IT’S A CRIME AGAINST THE FUTURE.

You don’t get to say “I’m open to evidence” when the evidence is screaming: lives are being erased under the banner of “liberty.” The cost? Not abstract. Not theoretical. Real. Irreversible.

If you’re not screaming it from the rooftops — you’re not trying.

👇 Drop your stance. No gray zones. No “I’m still thinking.” Just YES or NO — and why.
